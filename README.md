# Articles
Symfony project which displays articles from the database

## Functionality
- Able to create new articles and store them inside a database
- Ability to delete articles, with confirmation
- Edit typos in articles

### System requirements
In order to launch the program, the system must have some sort of web server and PHP installed.

#### Web server
Any kind of web server works, but I used XAMPP while making this project. To launch the program on XAMPP, you need to paste the project into xampp/htdocs directory.
Make sure you restart Apache and MySQL to make sure everything is running as intended.

In a web browser type: localhost/{project folder name}/public and you will have the program running on your local machine.
If you wish to access the local database, in your browser type: localhost/phpmyadmin
